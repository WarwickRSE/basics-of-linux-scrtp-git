    "# Combining Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core philosophical building blocks of bash is the concept of joining up small commands to create a greater whole.\n",
    "We can use commands like cat, head, tail in combination with the commands we will look into in this notebook to make powerful scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commands that link things\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipe `|`\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe is a relatively simple concept it takes the output of one command and puts it into the following command. Technically, it connects the STDOUT with the STDIN of the next. The output of the first command is immediately ingested by the second and processed accordingly. An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "ls treasure_hunt/search_in_here | more\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this is the result of ls made scrollable by more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing `wc` or word count (use man to see the options, in particular `-l` used here)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "ls treasure_hunt/search_in_here | wc -l\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you the number of items in this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redirects `>`, `>>`, &, `<`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STDOUT Redirect\n",
    "\n",
    "Redirects `>` and `>>` are similar to pipes in as much as they take the STDOUT (the output, but not the errors which are STDERR) and do things with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take the example of the `coordinate_run.sh` which prints messages about its status to STDOUT. \n",
    "We may not be monitoring this or it may be running on a remote system where we cannot observe STDOUT. We can use `>` to redirect the output to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "./coordinate_run.sh > run_log.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes the output of `coordinate_run.sh` and puts it in the text file `run_log.txt`.\n",
    "`run_log.txt` can be inspected in the usual ways to see the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this `>>` is similar but crucially appends to the file whereas `>` overwrites the file, both will create a file that does not exist. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# make the file\n",
    "echo 'Hello' > test.txt\n",
    "head test.txt\n",
    "echo 'World' > test.txt\n",
    "head test.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "rm test.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "echo 'Hello' >> test.txt\n",
    "head test.txt\n",
    "echo 'World' >> test.txt\n",
    "head test.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running the above to see the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STDIN Redirect\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip-side we can also direct stdin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following Python script\n",
    "\n",
    "stdin_example.py:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def read_input():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Read multiple lines of input until EOF.\"\"\"\n",
    "    lines = []\n",
    "    print(\"Enter lines of text (press Ctrl+D to end input):\")\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        while True:\n",
    "            line = input()\n",
    "            lines.append(line)\n",
    "    except EOFError:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    return lines\n",
    "\n",
    "def compare_lines(lines):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Compare lines to check if they are all identical.\"\"\"\n",
    "    if not lines:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "    first_line = lines[0]\n",
    "    for line in lines[1:]:\n",
    "        if line != first_line:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    return True\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    lines = read_input()\n",
    "    if compare_lines(lines):\n",
    "        print(\"All lines are identical.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Lines are not identical.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this code you are presented with a prompt to enter text ending with Ctrl+D.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you instead run the code like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 stdin_example.py < input.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will consume the content of `input.txt` instead of command line input.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try this out for yourself by copying the python code into a file called `stdin_example.py` and using an editor like vim to make and edit `input.txt` to contain various lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commands that sort things\n",
    "\n",
    "The next set of commands useful to know are for filtering and sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following its recommended to view the `man` page in supplement to the description given here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `grep`\n",
    "\n",
    "`grep` searches within a list of given input (files or stdin) for a given regular expression. \n",
    "The output of `grep` is then highly customizable to enable different reporting of what has been found and where. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `find`\n",
    "\n",
    "`find` is used to search though directory structures to locate a file matching an expression.\n",
    "It has a vast amount of different parameters to specify, how, what, and where to search. \n",
    "A simple example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "find . -type f -name myfile\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This searchers the current directory `.` and subdirectories as find is by default recursive.\n",
    "Then looks for files `-type f` which excludes directory names.\n",
    "Then gives it the search pattern `-name myfile` which is the name myfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice the best way to use find is to look for an example of your use case and modify it, for example the above comes from [this page https://linuxhandbook.com/find-command-examples/](https://linuxhandbook.com/find-command-examples/) which has tonnes of examples you could modify to your own needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `uniq`\n",
    "\n",
    "`uniq` is a filter that looks for unique lines in a given input file.\n",
    "It compares adjacent lines outputting single copies of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example take the following file `repeats.txt` and pass it to uniq:\n",
    "\n",
    "repeats.txt:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "\n",
    "blue\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "white\n",
    "white\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "green\n",
    "red\n",
    "red\n",
    "red\n",
    "green\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "uniq repeats.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "\n",
    "blue\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "white\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "green\n",
    "red\n",
    "green\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's removed all *adjacent* repetitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `sort`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort sorts the input it's given by default its alphabetic but with `-n` it can be numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try sort on `repeats.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "\n",
    "blue\n",
    "green\n",
    "green\n",
    "red\n",
    "red\n",
    "red\n",
    "white\n",
    "white\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could then use a combo of sort and uniq to remove all repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "sort repeats.txt | uniq > norepeats.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then check the content of `norepeats.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you could use sort `-u` but that is less fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `grep` we will need to understand a bit about REGular EXpressions (regex).\n",
    "Most of regex is outside of the scope of this course, most people only learn the specific little bit of regex they need to solve the problem in front of them.\n",
    "I again recommend [Regex Generator](https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look for the letter `l` in repeats.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex for matching a single character is just that character, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "grep l repeats.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "blue\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "yellow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the flag `-n` gives us the line in the file, try that matching a string is the string `red`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "grep red repeats.txt -n\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "\n",
    "7:red\n",
    "8:red\n",
    "9:red\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Something a bit more useful, match either `l` or `d`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "grep ld repeats.txt -n\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "\n",
    "1:blue\n",
    "2:yellow\n",
    "5:yellow\n",
    "7:red\n",
    "8:red\n",
    "9:red\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for these examples you can also see the filename associated with the match useful for when you are searching multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "grep ld repeats.txt norepeats.txt -H\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

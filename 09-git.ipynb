    "> In some cases, branches are used to separate versions of code that have different defaults such as a code which has been written with a GPU backend and a CPU backend but the frontend api is consistent.\n",

    "### `main` and `dev`\n",
    "\n",
    "To start this process we should ensure we have two standard branches, `main` and `dev`. \n",
    "`main` as we have seen is the primary or default branch it should be kept in a working state.\n",
    "Thus to make any change we will require another branch to test any additions, we will call this `dev`.\n",

    "> The idea of this style of development is to keep main as the 'release' version.\n",
    "> It will always work and is what is documented for people to use and you can point to it (and specific versions of it via commits or releases) in papers.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Dev is also protected from direct `push`es and only updated via pull requests.\n",
    "> To make changes we use a specific feature branch, I like to use `GitHub issues` to create branches although the nomenclature here starts to fail us.\n",
    "> You can also just make branches using `git branch <branch-name>`, then follow as above but making changes on your new branch and doing a pull request to dev.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Once you have committed a given number of features to `dev` so it has a new ability or function, and most importantly has been tested to stable, you can merge that to `main`.\n",
    "> For more complicated projects you can expect to find more complicated structures, or unfortunately no structure which then can be very hard work.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of using GH to do this branching for the above workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to issues in the navbar\n",

    "Click new issue, use the form to create an issue and description.\n",

    "\n",
    "A pop up box gives you a generated branch name, best leave it as is, and a bit of other information. The one thing we do want to change is to swap the branch source from `main` to `dev`.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Merging it all back together\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we have 2 pull requests and can merge them to dev one by one, note normally you would have a reviewer audit and merge your pull request to avoid mistakes but here we will do them.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can also go back to the issues and click close issue on each of them to show that we have stopped tracking them.\n",
    "It's good practice to close with a comment to note the pull request that solved this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go back to your local and do a `git fetch origin` and then `checkout dev`. \n",
    "Use the pull request method to pull `dev` into `main` noting that it contains content for b and file_d.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see from this process that `main` remained more stable. \n",
    "In practicality dev could have as many pull requests as needed and main would only have one that would have been run though testing to make sure it met the repositories standards.\n",

    "That's it use git like that and you'll thank yourself later.\n",

    "3. git pull origin dev\n",
    "4. checkout feature branch\n",

    "6. resolve conflicts\n",
    "7. push feature branch\n",

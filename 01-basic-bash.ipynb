    "# Basics of Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this course we will use the command line accessed via the terminal. \n",
    "Not technically correct but you will be forgiven for equating terminal, shell, bash, and command line as a singular thing, the differences are important but not for today.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means all our commands will be text based, we will start by mapping your existing knowledge of computer systems into the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to open the command line, from the linux desktop go to applications then look for `Terminal` it also appears as a small black box next to the firefox icon in the top left.\n",
    "This fresh terminal will have a line with some combination of text usually including your username the machine name and the type of shell you have entered and finally a symbol `>, :, $, %` being the most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where am I and what else is here?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the CLI (command line interface) to show us anything at all we will need to issue a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where am I?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pwd` means 'print working directory', this will for a fresh terminal be your `home` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/\\<department\\>/\\<username\\>'\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is called a `path` or `file path`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note my use of \\<some text\\> to signify things that are unique to you or something generic to be interpreted by you\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking this down, `/` is the root of the file system, `<thing>` means inside this folder `/` is used between folders to show one is in the other.\n",
    "So the above meant from root, `/`, we are in department, and within department in username. This is your `home` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is here?\n",
    "\n",
    "`ls` means 'list', this will show all the things in your `home` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be different for everyone but will have `Documents`, `Desktop`, `Downloads`, and other folders that don't start with D.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Moving, and Making\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving around\n",
    "\n",
    "In a graphical user interface (GUI) you navigate by clicking on files or using the back button.\n",
    "In the CLI you use a text command `cd` that stands for change directory.\n",
    "To move into the `Documents` folder you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd Documents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`pwd` and `ls` will now show a new `path` and list of files and folders. \n",
    "If you haven't used the system before documents will be empty and `ls` will show nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make bigger jumps using `cd /<file>/<path>/<from>/<root>` for example to go to your desktop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /home/<department>/<user>/Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying \\<department\\> and \\<user\\> to the values seen earlier.\n",
    "Then use `ls` and `pwd` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a big jump (or an unintentional jump) we can use a shortcut.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd -\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to get back to where we came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aside on special location symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "`/` with nothing before it means root, we are familiar with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "`~/` is a shortcut to your home directory, it again can have nothing before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.` means the directory we are currently in, almost like a symbolic representation of `pwd` not immediatly obvious why this is useful but it comes in handy more often than you may imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "`..` means the directory containing this, can be chained `../..` means go up 2 directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "p.s. `cd` with no arguments always takes you to `home`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "In the documents folder: use `pwd` to check where you are, and `cd ~/Documents` to get there if you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make a directory for use in this course, this is equivalent to using 'new folder' via a right click or GUI element; the command for making a new directory is `mkdir` or make directory. \n",
    "So to create a new folder called `basics_of_linux`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir basics_of_linux\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note we don't use spaces spaces are used to separate commands so folder and file names tend to follow one of two conventions. \n",
    "First is 'snake_case' each space is replaced by an underscore. \n",
    "Second is 'camelCase' each space is removed and the following letter capitalized first letters are lowercase.\n",
    "There are others and all do much the same thing with different capitalizations and separators like underscore and dash.\n",
    "I like snake_case as it has been shown to have the highest readability, but most important is consistency.\n",
    "It's also common to see a mixture of two where one is used for files and one is used for directories.\n",
    "For the remainder of this course we will use snake_case for everything and rely on the terminal to highlight the folders for us which is common in most modern shells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we move into the basics of linux folder \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd basics_of_linux\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can make a file we will create a README to explain what this folder is for, to do this we use `touch`\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note I immediately break my snake_case rule as README is special.\n",
    "We cannot currently write to this file but we will do that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copying stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I want to get the materials for the following exorcise to do this we need to copy them from where they are stored, I can use `cp` which stands for copy but we will use a special command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# make the folder to move the material into\n",
    "mkdir treasure_hunt\n",
    "# Copy recursively, this means the folder and all folders within the folder, the material from \n",
    "# `/home/shared/csc/Teaching/itl_treasure_hunt/. to ./treasure_hunt\n",
    "cp -r /home/shared/csc/Teaching/itl_treasure_hunt/. ./treasure_hunt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note here that I used a flag on a command cp if used basically will only copy a file from source to destination, using -r tells cp to copy a whole file.\n",
    "To be able to understand everything a bash command can do we can use `man` which stands for manual, followed by the command we want to inspect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "man cp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this the output is long and complicated, but the synopsis gives us a good reading of what we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SYNOPSIS\n",
    "       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST\n",
    "       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY\n",
    "       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...\n",
    "\n",
    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can copy a file from source to dest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy multiple files from source to dest but dest must be a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy multiple files from source to dest but using the -t to put the target directory as the first argument\n",
    "\n",
    "and we are using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "-R, -r, --recursive\n",
    "       copy directories recursively\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make source take a directory and move all its subdirectories and files to a destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "`man` is helpful but is more of a technical reference than a user manual, sometimes a quick web-search will give you a clearer answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `man` on `ls` we see that it can take some options and an argument that defaults to `.`, we can use this to peek into treasure hunt without using `cd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "ls -l treasure_hunt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`-l` is giving the long list format that is sometimes better to read\n",
    "\n",
    "lets use `-a` to show all the things in the hunt directory\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# -la is equivalent to -l -a\n",
    "ls -la treasure_hunt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we see another file `.README_FOR_SOLUTION.md` which is a hidden file using `.<name of file>` to make it invisible to `ls` unless we use `-a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving stuff \n",
    "\n",
    "That hidden file is for the solutions directory lets make a solution folder and move it over:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir treasure_hunt_solution\n",
    "mv ./treasure_hunt/.README_FOR_SOLUTION.md ./treasure_hunt_solution/README.md\n",
    "# look to see whats happened\n",
    "ls -la treasure_hunt\n",
    "ls -la treasure_hunt_solution\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The file should now be in your new solutions folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting things\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw in the treasure hunt that there is a couple of junk files, we need to remove them, step in rm\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "man rm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can remove the file using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rm treasure_hunt/junk_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can remove the folder using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rm -r treasure_hunt/junk_folder/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick `ls` confirms they are gone:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -la treasure_hunt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A final note, you will see `.` and `..` when using ls -a this is because they are in every single file and refer to the files we mentioned earlier in `cd` so `.` is this current folder and `..` is the folder above this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# First worked example \n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the treasure hunt folder as a resource to practice using the terminal effectively.\n",

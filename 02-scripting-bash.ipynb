    "# Scripting Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting is almost always preferable to running commands line by line for any process you will do with regularity. \n",
    "Also it improves reproducibility and reliability, if a bash process is a part of your data pipeline then you need to be able to justify, reproduce and share it in your papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start scripting there are a few more simple bash concepts we want to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looking in and working with files: cat, more, head, tail\n",
    "\n",
    "### `cat`, again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The man page of cat is excellent we used cat to read a single file. \n",
    "We can read multiple files by passing them as multiple arguments.\n",
    "We can con**cat**enate files by providing two files then redirecting `>` the output to a third file.\n",
    "We can modify and visualize files by modifying them using the `-` options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantastic, keep this in mind it will be used later refer back to `man cat` to get the commands you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `more` (or `less`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The man of more will, more or less, shame you into using `less`. You'll see `more` used a lot because habits are hard to break. \n",
    "Both are similar `less` is better. \n",
    "We will continue with `less` but the extent of our use wont go much past what `more` aside from the ability to scroll up.\n",
    "\n",
    "`less filename` will launch into a program that allows you to inspect the file, up and down arrows scroll the file, space jumps a windows worth of lines, return/enter scrolls one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit press `q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The man page will show you all of the things we can do with more to search and filter text files this won't be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `head` and `tail`\n",
    "\n",
    "`head` and `tail` read lines from the top and bottom of a file respectively.\n",
    "With `head` this is really useful for checking the headers of files, i.e. column names in CSVs and the first few data rows. \n",
    "And with `tail` if you have some program writing logs to a file, e.g logging in python, and you want to quickly check the last few logged lines tail will do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both take `-n` as an argument to specify the number of lines to take off the top or bottom. \n",
    "If `-n` isn't supplied then you get 10 lines.\n",
    "Check out the man pages for the other useful things they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus `echo`\n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly saw echo in the `*` aside. \n",
    "It fits to talk about it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo` returns a line to the standard output, the terminal.\n",
    "Looking at man shows it is short and simple command. \n",
    "It's most useful for checking what a wildcard or command would do before you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo rm *` \n",
    "\n",
    "Would show all the files that rm would try and remove from the wildcard expansion.\n",
    "There are more expansions where this is useful go look at regex, [helpful website here](https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org).\n",
    "Regex is outside of the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be used in scripts to print messages to the user running the script which is how we will se it used shortly.\n",
